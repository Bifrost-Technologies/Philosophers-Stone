Machine Learning Cognitive Service capable of forecasting the crypto markets!
Utilizing Microsoft Machine Learning & Intel MKL.

The datasets are pulled in real-time from coinbase pro API for less noise and cleaner market data. The Source of the candle data will affect predictions. 
Forecasts are stored locally and announced through telegram for remote access. 

Forecast correlated markets to produce a crystal clear image of the future. You can determine the probability of the forecast being accurate by checking to see if other correlated markets share the same outcome for the future. If BTC goes up 3% then other strongly correlated markets should be going up as well. Do not trade based solely on one prediction because at any moment the prediction can change as it does for the weather forecasts.  Consistently check to see if the forecast is following the same trajectory and has not changed directions. Forecasting tighter dilations like 15-minute and 1-hour forecasts will yield better real-time results, especially for future & margin markets.

Example runs the cognitive service in a neural tree running 6 dimensions of the service.
